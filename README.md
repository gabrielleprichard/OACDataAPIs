# OACDataAPIs
This repo contains the Postman collection for using the OAC Public APIs.

In the PostmanCollections folder, you will find two files.
1. APICollection.json - This file contains the Postman Collection with a set of API requests for authorization, data flow execution, and sequence execution.
2. postman_environment.json - This file contains the Postman environment variables that you can reuse in your requests.

Copy the link to the raw file for each of these files and import them into Postman to get started using the OAC Public REST APIs.
